# Background-Changer-Mobile-App


As a practice project, I have developed a mobile app using React Native that allows users to change the background color of the app to any random color. This app is called "Random Color Background" and is a simple yet fun tool that users can use to change the look and feel of their device's screen.

Upon opening the app, users are presented with a button labeled "Press Me". When this button is pressed, the app generates a random color code and sets it as the background color of the app. The color code is displayed in both hexadecimal and RGB format, so users can easily use the color code in other applications if desired.

The app's user interface is designed to be minimalistic and user-friendly, with a clean and modern design that allows users to focus on the primary functionality of the app: changing the background color. The app is also responsive, meaning that it will work seamlessly on devices with varying screen sizes.

To build this app, I utilized the power of React Native, a popular JavaScript framework for building native mobile apps. React Native allowed me to create a single codebase that works across both iOS and Android platforms, significantly reducing development time and effort.

Overall, "Random Color Background" is a fun and simple app that serves as a great introduction to React Native development. It showcases how to use state management and event handling in React Native, as well as how to generate random colors using JavaScript. As a beginner project, it's perfect for those who are just starting with React Native or want to practice their skills in a simple and engaging way.
